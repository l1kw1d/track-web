I suggest integration with the Certificate transparency project, Facebook allow the use of the API they build. 
https://developers.facebook.com/tools/ct/search/

I can integrate those logs https://www.certificate-transparency.org/known-logs , or simply use the search function from facebook API as strong layer to this project
I can tune the phising alerts for a more "related" way to our canadians users.

I can also contibute to all the docs in french too. (or help in the integration support of tools like https://documents.reverso.net/Default.aspx?lang=en , for quick translation)
